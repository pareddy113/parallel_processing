# parallel_processing
parallel processing course project 1


To introduce to run very simple MPI-2 programs (use C) on the EXTREME cluster and familiarize with simple MPI-2 calls, and how to execute programs on clusters.


The goal is to create a large array A of n numbers at one node (let us call it the source node), distribute blocks of the array across the processors, and find the global sum of the numbers in A.


Use and familiarize with different topologies such as Ring, Tree and Hypercube with different configurations of sending data between Processors.

Uses MPI to communicate with processors and submit the job to the Server.

RUN:
Needs to be run on a Cluster that supports MPI
